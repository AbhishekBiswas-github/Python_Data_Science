# Student Grading Analysis Using Pandas & NumPy

## Introduction
In the modern educational system, analyzing student performance is crucial for identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement. This project focuses on **Student Grading Analysis** using **Pythonâ€™s Pandas** and **NumPy libraries** to process, clean, and derive insights from student data.

The dataset consists of various attributes such as **student ID, department, grades, scores, attendance, study hours, family income level, and stress levels, etc**. 

## Through this project, we aim to:

* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, standardizing data).
* Analyze student performance based on multiple parameters (scores, attendance, study hours, etc.).
* Identify trends and correlations (e.g., impact of study hours on grades).
* Categorize students into performance levels (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor).
* Use pivot tables and statistical analysis for deeper insights.
* This project provides a structured approach to understanding student performance and can be extended to make data-driven decisions in education systems.
