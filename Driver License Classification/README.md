# Driver License Classification

## Project Description

The **Driver License Classification** project is a comprehensive machine learning solution designed to automate and enhance the decision-making process for driver license qualification. By leveraging a detailed dataset containing both demographic information and performance assessment scores from applicant driving evaluations, this project aims to classify applicants as *Qualified* or *Not Qualified* for a driver’s license.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** Includes systematic steps for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing (encoding, scaling), and robust model development.
- **Insightful Visualizations:** Provides feature distribution plots and a correlation heatmap to make the data and its relationships interpretable.
- **Unsupervised Learning Model:** Utilizes KMeans clustering, combined with appropriate evaluation metrics, to group applicants and generate classification labels.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Highlights which features most strongly influence the licensing decision, offering transparency and actionable insights.
- **Interactive Prediction Tool:** Allows users to input new applicant data and receive real-time license qualification predictions using the trained model.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Import and preprocess raw applicant data; handle missing values and remove irrelevant columns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Explore the dataset’s structure, check distributions, and summarize key statistical insights.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encode categorical variables and scale features to ensure compatibility with ML algorithms.

4. **Visualization**
   - Visualize feature distributions and feature-target correlations for data-driven model design.

5. **Model Building**
   - Train a KMeans clustering model, tune cluster count, and map clusters to qualification outcomes.
   - Evaluate model performance via confusion matrix and classification metrics.

6. **Prediction for New Data**
   - Accept new applicant input and predict license qualification status with the trained model.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run the main notebook or script following the documented sections. Ensure required dependencies are installed. Example workflows and usage instructions are provided within the code documentation.

## Impact & Benefits

- **Reduces Subjectivity:** Automates assessments to reduce human bias and make the licensing process more objective.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Identifies critical factors that influence successful licensing decisions, helping authorities refine their evaluation criteria.
- **Practical Application:** Provides a ready-to-use tool for real-time driver license qualification predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Machine Learning (KMeans, StandardScaler, OrdinalEncoder)
- Data Visualization
