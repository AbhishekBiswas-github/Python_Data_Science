# Diabetes Project

## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide and poses serious health complications if not managed effectively. Understanding patterns within patient data can play a critical role in identifying risk factors, improving early diagnosis, and tailoring treatment strategies.

This project delves into a dataset of diabetic patients using Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. By analyzing demographic information, clinical indicators, and patient history, the project extracts meaningful insights that can support healthcare decision-making and enhance awareness of diabetic trends among various groups.


### Project aims to 

The primary objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a diabetes patient dataset to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that can inform medical understanding and interventions. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. Identify the most affected age groups and compare their clinical metrics.
2. Explore the distribution of diabetic conditions across genders.
3. Analyze key health indicators such as blood glucose, BMI, cholesterol, hemoglobin, and GGT levels.
4. Understand correlations (if any) between physiological factors using visual tools such as heatmaps and boxplots.
5. Evaluate the role of family history in the prevalence of diabetes.
6. Present the findings through intuitive and interactive visualizations to aid interpretability.
